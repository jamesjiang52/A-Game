There are nominally six different combat options:
Thrust
Slash
Parry
Dodge
Feint 
Disengage

With each damage attempt there are three possible results:
Missed - deals 0% of damage		    15% of the time
Normal - deals 100% of damage		70% of the time
Critical - deals 200% of damage		15% of the time
(when the probabilities are changed, they are added/deducted from the normal)

Thrust (+10% critical, +5% missed):
 - significant victory: parry (deal damage + opponent stagger)
 - slight victory: feint (deal damage)
 - slight defeat: disengage (stagger)
 - significant defeat: dodge (stagger + +10% opponent critical next turn)
 - draws: slash (deal significant damage + take significant damage)
 - draws: thrust (deal damage + take damage)

Slash (-10% missed, -5% critical):
 - significant victory: dodge (deal significant damage)
 - slight victory: feint (deal damage)
 - slight defeat: disengage (+10% opponent critical next turn)
 - significant defeat: parry (stagger + -10% opponent missed next turn)
 - draws: thrust (deal significant damage + take significant damage)
 - draws: slash (deal damage + take damage)

Parry (-5% critical):
 - significant victory: slash (opponent stagger + -10% opponent missed next turn)
 - significant victory: disengage (significant opponent stagger)
 - significant defeat: feint (stagger + -10% opponent missed next turn)
 - significant defeat: thrust (take damage + stagger)
 - draws: dodge (stagger + opponent stagger)
 - draws: parry (nothing)

Dodge (+5% missed):
 - significant victory: thrust (opponent stagger + +10% critical next turn)
 - significant victory: disengage (significant opponent stagger)
 - significant defeat: feint (stagger + +10% opponent critical next turn)
 - significant defeat: slash (take significant damage)
 - draws: parry (stagger + opponent stagger)
 - draws: dodge (nothing)

Feint (+5% opponent stagger):
 - significant victory: parry (opponent stagger + -10% missed next turn)
 - significant victory: dodge (opponent stagger + +10% critical next turn)
 - slight defeat: thrust (take damage)
 - slight defeat: slash (take damage)
 - slight defeat: disengage (+5% opponent critical next turn + -5% opponent missed next turn)
 - draws: feint (stagger + opponent stagger)

Disengage (-5% stagger):
 - slight victory: thrust (opponent stagger)
 - slight victory: slash (+10% critical next turn)
 - slight victory: feint (+5% critical next turn + -%5 missed next turn)
 - significant defeat: parry (significant stagger)
 - significant defeat: dodge (significant stagger)

With the usage of a shield, to more options are unlocked:
Block
Bash

With each damage attempt(bash) there is one possible results:
Normal - deals 100% of damage		100% of the time

Block: 
 - significant victory: thrust (opponenet stagger + chance opponent has to change weapon + -5% missed next turn)
 - significant victory: slash (opponenet stagger + chance opponent has to change weapon + +5% critical next turn)
 - slight victory: disengage (opponenet stagger)
 - slight defeat: feint (+5% opponent critical next turn + -5% opponent missed next turn)
 - slight defeat: dodge (stagger)
 - slight defeat: parry (stagger)
 - draws: bash (both shields are broken and cannot be used for the rest of the fight)
 - draws: block (nothing)

Bash:
 - significant victory: parry (deal slight damage + opponent stagger + chance opponent has to change weapon)
 - significant victory: dodge (deal slight damage + significant stagger)
 - slight victory: feint (deal slight damage + stagger)
 - slight defeat: disengage (stagger)
 - slight defeat: thrust (take damage)
 - slight defeat: slash (take damage)
 - draws: block (both shields are broken and cannot be used for the rest of the fight)
 - draws: bash (both shields are broken and cannot be used for the rest of the fight + deal slight damage + take slight damage + stagger + opponent stagger)

All effects are temporary and lasts for the next turn
