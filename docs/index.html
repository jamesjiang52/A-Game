            Ten years. Ten years of mindless back-breaking labour, ten years of constant under-appreciation, ten 
            years of verbal abuse, ten years of manipulation and deceit. Ten years endured, and for what? 
            Demotion and an official reprimand for "unprofessional" conduct. These were the thoughts that raged 
            through my mind as I approached <i>Reinbreaker</i>, the towering presence that loomed over the entire 
            valley, its impregnability famed across the land. Considered the sole reason why the west had 
            remained relatively unmarred after the many years of war, the fortress stood proudly along the 
            river, shining as a beacon of imperial might. Tonight, this will change, its illusion of power 
            destroyed, the mighty empire brought to its knees, and I shall be the cause. My name once revered as 
            the next imperator will now be spit upon alongside the dregs and scum, but vengeance must have its 
            due.

        <p>Outside Fortress Walls</p>
        <p>
            I am on a narrow cobblestoned trail. Just up ahead to the north is the stronghold, a mere minute's 
            walk away, its imperial towers and walls standing unshaken against the cannons of war unending. Just 
            off the path and down the hill, the river roars its great presence, mighty and boisterous. To the 
            south, I can only see the unbroken plains of grass ripple and roll as the evening gale sings its 
            serene nocturne against the fading light.

            It appears I can move in these directions:<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- north<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- south<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- river<br>
