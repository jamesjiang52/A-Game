                Ten years. Ten years of mindless back-breaking labour, ten years of constant under-appreciation, ten years of verbal abuse, ten years of manipulation and deceit. Ten years endured, and for what? Demotion and an 
                official reprimand for "unprofessional" conduct. These were the thoughts that raged through my mind as I approached <i>Reinbreaker</i>, the towering presence that loomed over the entire valley, its impregnability 
                famed across the land. Considered the sole reason why the west had remained relatively unmarred after the many years of war, the fortress stood proudly along the river, shining as a beacon of imperial might. 
                Tonight, this will change, its illusion of power destroyed, the mighty empire brought to its knees, and I shall be the cause. My name once revered as the next imperator will now be spit upon alongside the dregs 
                and scum, but vengeance must have its due.<br><br>

                Outside Fortress Walls<br><br>
                
                I am on a narrow cobblestoned trail. Just up ahead to the north is the stronghold, a mere minute's walk away, its imperial towers and walls standing unshaken against the cannons of war unending. Just off the path 
                and down the hill, the river roars its great presence, mighty and boisterous. To the south, I can only see the unbroken plains of grass ripple and roll as the evening gale sings its serene nocturne against the 
                fading light.<br><br>
                
                It appears I can move in these directions:<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- north<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- south<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- river<br>
