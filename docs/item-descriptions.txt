//Weapons

Stone Sword:
3 lbs
3 dmg, +10% stagger
A slab of rock sharpened to carry a point, it is awkward to handle and difficult to maneuver. It is more akin to a club than a blade

Bronze Sword:
4 lbs
4 dmg
Approximately sixty centimetres in length, this blade is adorned with a crude wooden hilt.

Iron Sword:
5 lbs
8 dmg, +5% stagger
Your everyday sword found within castle armouries, it bends rather easily but does not break.

War Rapier:
3 lbs
14 dmg, -5% stagger
A long thin blade with a very sharp tip, it has an intricately complex hilt that wraps around to protect the hand of its user. Due to its slenderness it is much more suited for nimble thrusting attacks rather than sweeping cuts.

War Sabre:
5 lbs
16 dmg, +5% stagger
A curved blade that provides a large cutting edge, great for finishing off enemies that refuse to die. The hilt is adorned with gemstones that glow in the darkness.

Star Sword:
3 lbs
12 dmg, -5% stagger, 2 hp enemy drain per turn once hit
Made of from the remains of a fallen star, the blade is as pale as glass, impossibly sharp, and inflicts a cool burn to those who are cut by it

Fire Sword:
5 lbs
12 dmg, +10% enemy stagger, 1 hp drain per turn, 3 hp enemy drain per turn once hit
Flame flickers constantly along the blade; I wonder how the fire doesn't burn out?

Spear:
1 lbs
7 dmg, -5% stagger
A long handle of polished wood with a sharp tip; an ideal weapon to keep the enemy at a distance.

Rusty Mace:
8 lbs
6 dmg, +15% stagger, 10% enemy armor reduction, unable to use shield
Once a formidable weapon, its spiked head is slowly rusting away, leaving behind a mess of iron and flakes.

Two-handed Mace:
7 lbs
13 dmg, +20% stagger, 15% enemy armor reduction, unable to use shield
This fearsome weapon is almost a metre-and-a-half long and carries a spiked steel head capable of smashing through even the sturdiest of armor.

Battle Axe:
7 lbs
13 dmg, +15% stagger, 10% enemy armor reduction, unable to use shield
With a crescent-shaped head and a long thick handle, this axe was modified from its woodcutting cousin to become a terror on the battlefield.

Morningstar:
6 lbs
Regular: 10 dmg, +10% stagger, 10% enemy armour reduction, unable to use shield
Against Shields: 10 dmg, +10% stagger, +25% enemy stagger, 50% enemy armour reduction
A cruel spiked ball is connected by chain to the head of a wooden rod.

Wooden Dagger:
0 lb
1 dmg, +1% enemy stagger
Crudely carved into a point with a handle, I guess it can be used as a distraction.

Diamond Dagger:
0 lb
2 dmg, +1% enemy stagger (first usage +20% enemy stagger)
Extremely hard but perpetually blunt, it is in theory a good weapon, but is more suited for ceremonial purposes.

Obsidian Dagger:
0 lb
6 dmg, -10% stagger, +1% enemy stagger (first usage +20% enemy stagger)
Sharp beyond imagination, and with a gold-plated hilt, it is worth fortunes.

Trident:
5 lbs
8 dmg, +5% enemy stagger
A majestic three-pronged head is mounted on a long handle adorned with life-like carved sea creatures.

Whip:
2 lbs
6 dmg, +10% enemy stagger, +50% enemy armor effectiveness
Glowing a sinister red in the torchlight, any hit from this must be painful.

Stone:
0 lbs
0 dmg
This is impressively round... and grey... and smooth ... who am I kidding at least I won't miss it when I throw it.

Excalibur:
Without rainbow stone:
	6 lbs
	12 dmg, unable to use shield
	Could this be... the legendary sword of King Arthur? Something seems slightly off, but I can't seem to put my finger on it...
With rainbow stone:
	6 lbs
	24 dmg, unable to use shield
	The legendary sword of King Arthur is complete with the rainbow stone in its pommel!


//Defensive Items

Street Clothes:
1 lbs
1 armor
The uniform of a lowly soldier consists of a navy coat, black pants, and sturdy boots.

Leather Jacket: 
1 lbs
2 armor, +1% enemy stagger
While impressive looking, it is not able to withstand much

Chainmail:
20 lbs
20 armor, +20% stagger
Made of interlocking iron rings that are welded shut, it can withstand blows but has several vulnerable areas. It is also exceedingly heavy.

Plate Armor:
40 lbs
40 armor, +20% stagger
Made of joined plates of thick steel, it convers the body from head to toe and is impenetrable outside well positioned blows.

Paper Shield:
1 lb
1 armor
They actually make these things? I thought it was just a metaphor.

Wooden Shield:
5 lbs
10 armor
Light and mobile, it can be easily discarded when necessary.

Metal Shield:
10 lbs
15 armor, +5% stagger, +1% enemy stagger
It is more versatile than a wooden shield, but also more cumbersome. Perhaps the enemy may be dazzled by its shiny surface?

Aegis Replica:
10 lbs
15 armor, +1% stagger, +100% enemy stagger first turn 50% afterwards
This cannot be the real Aegis as I am not stone, but this is a most terrifying replica.
