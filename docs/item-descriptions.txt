War Rapier:
40 dmg, -5% stagger
A long thin blade with a very sharp tip, it has an intricately complex hilt that wraps around to protect the hand of its user. Due to its slenderness it is much more suited for nimble thursting attacks rather than sweeping cuts.

Crudely carved into a point with an handle: I guess it can still be used as a disctraction?
