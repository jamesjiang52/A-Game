//Weapons

Stone Sword:
1 dmg, +10% stagger
A slab of rock sharpened to carry a point, it is awkward to handle and difficult to maneuver.

Bronze Sword:
5 dmg
Approximately sixty centimetres in length, this blade is adorned with a crude wooden hilt.

Iron Sword:
10 dmg, +5% stagger
Your everyday sword found within castle armouries, it bends rather easily but does not break.

War Rapier:
50 dmg, -5% stagger
A long thin blade with a very sharp tip, it has an intricately complex hilt that wraps around to protect the hand of its user. Due to its slenderness it is much more suited for nimble thrusting attacks rather than sweeping cuts.

War Sabre:
60 dmg, +5% stagger
A curved blade that provides a large cutting edge, great for finishing off enemies that refuse to die. The hilt is adorned with gemstones that glow in the darkness.

Fire Sword:
15 dmg, +5% stagger, +5% enemy stagger
Flame flickers constantly along the blade; I wonder how the fire doesn't burn out?

Spear:
15 dmg, -5% stagger
A long handle of polished wood with a sharp tip; an ideal weapon to keep the enemy at a distance.

Rusty Mace:
20 dmg, +15% stagger, 10% enemy armour reduction, unable to use shield
Once a formidable weapon, its spiked head is slowly rusting away, leaving behind a mess of iron and flakes.

Two-handed Mace:
60 dmg, +20% stagger, 15% enemy armour reduction, unable to use shield
This fearsome weapon is almost a metre-and-a-half long and carries a spiked steel head capable of smashing through even the sturdiest of armor.

Battle Axe:
60 dmg, +15% stagger, 10% enemy armour reduction, unable to use shield
With a crescent-shaped head and a long thick handle, this axe was modified from its woodcutting cousin to become a terror on the battlefield.

Morningstar:
Regular: 40 dmg, +10% stagger, 10% enemy armour reduction, unable to use shield
Against Shields: 40 dmg, +10% stagger, +25% enemy stagger, 50% enemy armour reduction
A cruel spiked ball is connected by chain to the head of a wooden rod.

Wooden Dagger:
1 dmg, +1% enemy stagger
Crudely carved into a point with a handle, I guess it can be used as a distraction.

Diamond Dagger:
2 dmg, +1% enemy stagger (first usage +20% enemy stagger)
Extremely hard but perpetually blunt, it is in theory a good weapon, but is more suited for ceremonial purposes.

Obsidian Dagger:
20 dmg, -10% stagger, +1% enemy stagger (first usage +20% enemy stagger)
Sharp beyond imagination, and with a gold-plated hilt, it is worth fortunes.

Trident:
30 dmg, +5% enemy stagger
A majestic three-pronged head is mounted on a long handle adorned with life-like carved sea creatures.

Whip:
15 dmg, +10% enemy stagger, +50% enemy armor effectiveness
Glowing a sinister red in the torchlight, any hit from this must be painful.

Stone:
0 dmg
This is impressively round... and grey... and smooth ... who am I kidding at least I won't miss it when I throw it.

Excalibur:
Without rainbow stone:
	55 dmg
	Could this be... the legendary sword of King Arthur? Something seems slightly off, but I can't seem to put my finger on it...
With rainbow stone:
	80 dmg
	The legendary sword of King Arthur is complete with the rainbow stone in its pommel!


//Defensive Items

Street Clothes:
1 armor
The uniform of a lowly soldier consists of a navy coat, black pants, and sturdy boots.

Leather Jacket: 
2 armor, +1% enemy stagger
While impressive looking, it is not able to withstand much

Chainmail:
20 armor, +20% stagger
Made of interlocking iron rings that are welded shut, it can withstand blows but has several vulnerable areas. It is also exceedingly heavy.

Plate Armor:
40 armor, +20% stagger
Made of joined plates of thick steel, it convers the body from head to toe and is impenetrable outside well positioned blows.

Paper Shield:
1 armor
They actually make these things? I thought it was just a metaphor.

Wooden Shield:
10 armor
Light and mobile, it can be easily discarded when necessary.

Metal Shield:
15 armor, +5% stagger, +1% enemy stagger
It is more versatile than a wooden shield, but also more cumbersome. Perhaps the enemy may be dazzled by its shiny surface?

Aegis Replica:
15 armor, +1% stagger, +100% enemy stagger first turn 50% afterwards
This cannot be the real Aegis as I am not stone, but this is a most terrifying replica.


//Consumables

Loaf of Bread:
Heal 20%
"Acquired" from my second-favorite bakery, it was saved for a rainy day. It will soon rain... the tears of my enemies.

Bottle of Mead:
Heal 20%
Nothing soothes pain like a dash of mead - a single gulp and all is forgotten.

Square of Chocolate:
Heal 10%
There's nothing like the gooey wonderfulness of this brown-coloured delicacy.

Ambrosia:

It is the food of the gods, or so it is said. I'm sure they wont be angry if I take just a little bite.

Mysterious White Powder:
Random Effect: (heal 10%, heal 20%, heal 50%, -10% stagger, or -20% stagger), after five turns hidden effect (+50% stagger)
I was told that a couple of pinches will invigorate me from even the deepest of stupors.

The last embers glow faintly within.

The Art of War - Sun Tzu:

I am hit with stunning epiphany...

I hope this stone is more useful than the first one...

Quill:
If only I had something to write on...
