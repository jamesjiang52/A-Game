Outside Fortress Walls
River Shore - back

I am on a narrow cobblestoned trail. Just up ahead to the north is the stronghold, a mere minute's
walk away, its imperial towers and walls standing unshaken against the cannons of war unending. Just
off the path and down the hill, the river roars its great presence, mighty and boisterous. To my
south, I can only see the unbroken plains of grass ripple and roll as the evening gale sings its
serene nocturne against the fading light. The fortress calls me closer.


Outside Fortress Walls
Outside Fortress Walls – south

I turn around and try to leave, but the stronghold beckons me closer. I cannot leave until the
fortress is mine.


River Shore
Outside Fortress Walls – river

I veer off the path and put my foot into the water. It is freezing cold. I do not dare go into the
water with just my streets clothes, lest I lose my strength and become incapable of pulling myself
back to the safety of shore. I need to get back onto the path.


Fortress Gate
Outside Fortress Walls – north

I approach the first of the fortress' triple walls. I am greeted by a closed gate as I am commanded
to reveal what I carry. A standard issue iron sword, a lantern, a loaf of bread, a bottle of mead,
and the clothes on my back. Assent is given as the bridge is lowered and the gate is raised. Fools.
