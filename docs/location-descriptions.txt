Outside Fortress Walls

I am on a narrow cobblestoned trail. Just up ahead to the north is the stronghold, a mere minute's
walk away, its imperial towers and walls standing unshaken against the cannons of war unending. Just
off the path and down the hill, the river roars its great presence, mighty and boisterous. To the
south, I can only see the unbroken plains of grass ripple and roll as the evening gale sings its
serene nocturne against the fading light. The fortress calls me closer.

Outside Fortress Walls

I walk north along the beaten path, closer to the fortress. The sun's dusk paints the sky a grand
spectacle of amber and violet. I can see not a single cloud, not even a flurry. The fortress calls 
me closer.

I turn around and try to leave, but the stronghold beckons me closer. I cannot leave until the
fortress is mine.


River Shore

I veer off the path and dip my foot into the water. It is freezing cold. I do not dare go into the
water with just my streets clothes, lest I lose my strength and become incapable of pulling myself
back to the safety of shore. I need to get back onto the path.


Fortress Gate

I approach the first of the fortress' triple walls. I am greeted by a closed gate as I am commanded
to reveal what I carry. A stolen bronze sword, a lantern, a loaf of bread, a bottle of mead,
and the clothes on my back. Assent is given as the bridge is lowered and the gate is raised. Fools.
This is te beginning of the end.
