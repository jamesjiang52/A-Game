Outside the Fortress:
I am on a narrow cobblestoned trail. Just up ahead to the north is the stronghold, a mere minute's
walk away, its imperial towers and walls standing unshaken against the cannons of war unending. Just
off the path and down the hill, the river roars its great presence, mighty and boisterous. To the
south, I can only see the unbroken plains of grass ripple and roll as the evening gale sings its
serene nocturne against the fading light.

 - By the Fortress Walls:

River Shore:
I veer off the path and dip my foot into the water. It is freezing cold. I do not dare going further, 
lest I lose my strength and become incapable of pulling myself back to the safety of shore.
 - Outside the Fortress

South:
I turn around and try to leave, but I must remember my purpose. I cannot leave until the fortress is mine.
 - Outside the Fortress

By the Fortress Walls:
I walk north along the beaten path, closer to the fortress. The sun's dusk paints the sky a grand
spectacle of amber and violet. I can see not a single cloud, not even a flurry.

 - The Moat

The Moat:
I approach the first of the fortress' triple walls. I am greeted by a deep ditch and a raised bridge. I look
down to see a rush of inky black water at least two meters deep. Accross stands two watchmen that guard the gate,
one of whom greets me and commands me to reveal what I carry. A bronze sword, a lantern, a loaf of bread, 
a bottle of mead, and the clothes on my back. Assent is given as the bridge is lowered and the gate is raised. 
 - The Gate

The Gate:
I step accross the wooden bridge, careful to mind my steps and not trip. As I step off the other side a curious stone
catches my interest, impossibly smooth and round. Onwards, I am greeted by the two watchmen. Is it time for their reign
to end and mines to begin?

Inside the gate:
The first step of my masterplan is now complete with my gaining access to the fortress.
