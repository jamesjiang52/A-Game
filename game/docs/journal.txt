Ten years. Ten years of mindless back-breaking labour, ten years of constant under-appreciation, ten
years of verbal abuse, ten years of manipulation and deceit. Ten years endured, and for what?
Demotion and an official reprimand for “unprofessional” conduct. These were the thoughts that raged
through my mind as I approached Reinbreaker, the towering presence that loomed over the entire
valley, its impregnability famed across the land. Considered the sole reason why the west had
remained relatively unmarred after the many years of war, the fortress stood proudly along the
river, shining as a beacon of imperial might. Tonight, this will change, its illusion of power
destroyed, the mighty empire brought to its knees, and I shall be the cause. My name once revered as
the next imperator will now be spit upon alongside the dregs and scum, but vengeance must have its
due.
